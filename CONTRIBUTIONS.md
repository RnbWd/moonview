Contributions to MoonView are welcome. MoonView is a personal project with no deadlines (yet) or really no great ambitions. I just want to make stuff. 

Please checkout the issues for a roadmap of possible features that need work. 

If you do have an interest in getting involved, the project follows `standardjs` code formatting, with eslint. I'm trying out the semi-free lifestyle. 

Also note, this project is currently written in plain javascript. While I'm open to the idea of integrating a cool, neat-o framework, the start of the project didn't warrant it. Also, I didn't feel like doing config for days.

This doc (like everything else) is a work in progress.
