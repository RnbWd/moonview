MoonView is a minimalist text application built with electron. All current activity is happening on the development branch. 

The goal of MoonView is to create a "ambient" writing atmosphere, originally inspired by Ommwriter. The application aims to provide a space to write, with controlled options for listening to audio tracks (music, muzak, field recordings), font selection, and writing background. 

Please head over to the issues to look at road map.
